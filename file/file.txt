Note that, although read and write methods require a &mut File, because of the interfaces for Read and Write,
the holder of a  &File can still modify the file, either through methods that take &File or by retrieving
the underlying OS object and modifying the file that way. Additionally, many operating systems allow concurrent
modification of files by different processes. Avoid assuming that holding a &File means that the file will not change.
